# Text-Adventure
 Text adventure in Java with influence from Collosal Cave. 
 The game is played in the terminal using a Scanner to get input from the keyboard. You can run the program with Java 8.
 
Here are some puzzles ideas I had to be put in the adventure:
  1. There's a shed that needs a key to unlock it before you can open it. The key is in the ditch.
  2. The first thing you come to in the mine is an underground lake, to get across to any of the other passages you have to get in the boat that's by the shore first.
  3. At the mine entrance, there are loose nails that can be used to fix something else (I haven't decided what yet). You can't take them by hand or the mine entrance will collapse on you and kill you. To get the nails, you ohave to get the bow and arrow from the shed and "shoot" or "shoot arrow" at the mine entrance. That will send the nails flying and you can get them. It will also collapse the mine entrance, so if you want to do anything in the mine, do it before that. Or maybe there's another entrance somewhere I haven't decided that.
  4. There's a wheel with a shiny center and a shaft going deep into a dam. A magnet that can be aqcuired in a log cabin that, when dropped at the dam, will allow the wheel to turn. When the wheel is turned it will drain the lake, revealing a town that was flooded by the dam. If you know of Lake Dillon in Colorado, that's where I got that idea from.
